<b>Project Description</b>

Zyfra is a company that develops efciency solutions fo the heavy industry. We will be looking at the gold revocery process from gold ore. To study the data on extraction and purification. We will be creating an optimal predictive model that can esimate the amount of gold ore recovered during extraction. With this our model will help to optimize production and eliminate unprofitable paramers in the gold mining process.


<b>Technological Process:</b>
1. primary processing - Mined ore undergoes primary processing to get the ore mixture or rougher feed, which is the raw material for flotation (also known as the rougher process). After flotation, the material is sent to two-stage purification.
2. Flotation - Gold ore mixture is fed into the float banks to obtain rougher Au concentrate and rougher tails (product residues with a low concentration of valuable metals).
3. Pirification - The rougher concentrate undergoes two stages of purification. After purification, we have the final concentrate and new tails.


<b>Data Description:</b>

 Data is stored in three files:<br>

- gold_recovery_train.csv
- gold_recovery_test.csv
- gold_recovery_full.csv

<b>Evaluation Metric:</b> <br>

To find out optimal model we use a new metic called sMape (symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) in conjuction with a cross validation score to find our optimal model

Poject Steps:
- Data Preperation
- Data Analyzation
- Model Building
- Final Conclusioins
